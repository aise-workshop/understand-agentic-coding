# understand-agentic-coding


I'm writing an automated xx tool, using a two-stage AI invocation pattern.

First stage: Generate tool invocations based on the error to decide which files need to be read.  
Second stage: Based on the contents of the read files and the error information, generate the actual fix code.
   - [ ] `read-file`, `write-tile`, `str-replace` and `list-dir` tool

Please refer to your tool (Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf) and implement this AI Agent. Just give me the code for now, no edits yet.
